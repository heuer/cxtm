What is CXTM-tests?
-------------------
It is a suite of tests for Topic Maps implementations, based around
the various Topic Maps syntaxes. The intention is to help developers
of Topic Maps implementations verify that their implementations are
actually correct according to the specifications.
Each test consists of (at least) one input file with a corresponding
CXTM file. If a Topic Maps implementation works correctly, it has to
generate the same canonical output as specified by the reference CXTM
file.

Best regards,
the CXTM project
