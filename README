This is a collection of test cases for various Topic Maps syntaxes.
The subdirectories contain the following:

 - xtm1: Test cases for XTM 1.0. (All correct, but not complete.)
 - xtm2: Test cases for XTM 2.0. (All correct, but not complete.)
 - xtm21: Test cases for XTM 2.1. (All correct, but not complete.)
 - ltm: Test cases for LTM 1.3. (Status uncertain.)
 - ctm: Test cases for CTM 1.0. (All correct, but not complete.)
 - tmxml: Test cases for TM/XML
 - jtm: Test cases for JSON Topic Maps (JTM)
 - rdf: Test cases for the translation of RDF to Topic Maps (Status: uncertain)
 - tmcl: Test cases for the Topic Maps Constraint Language (TMCL) (Status: uncertain)

More directories may be added with time.

Note: The XTM 1.0 tests assume that the topic map is post-processed
The details of this process are described in the XTM 1.1 draft
dtd. 2005-07-20: <http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-xtm/2005-07-20/#sect-proc-topicMap>
That process converts XTM 1.0 reification into the TMDM reifier/reified property

Each subdirectory contains the following:

 - in: a directory containing files in the test syntax.
 - baseline: for each test file in the "in" directory the
   corresponding CXTM file with the same name and ".cxtm" appended
   will be found in this directory.
 - invalid: a directory containing files in the test syntax which
   are invalid.

An implementation passes the tests if:

 - for each file in "in" it produces a byte-by-byte identical
   canonicalization to what's in "baseline".
 - it rejects all files in the "invalid" directory.
