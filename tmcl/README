This directory contains conformance tests for TMCL, organized as follows:

level-1       Tests for conformance level 1 (ie: no TMQL).
  bad-schema  Tests where the schema itself is invalid.
  invalid     Tests where there is one violation of the schema.
  valid       Tests which are valid.

Each directory contains two versions of each test case with the same
file name and different extension (a.xtm and a.ctm).

For invalid tests the constraint which is violated will have the ID
"violated", and, where possible, the construct which violates it will
have the ID "violator".
